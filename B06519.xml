            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Poor <hi>Ireland</hi>'s groans breathe freſh into my mind,</l>
               <l>Anger by name to angry Foes conſign'd:</l>
               <l>Fates bailful ſtreams upon thee have been ſhed,</l>
               <l>And cruel hands have dy'd thy boſom red;</l>
               <l>A hundred thouſand ſacrificed lives</l>
               <l>By Tortures, Rack, and Maſſacreying Knives:</l>
               <l>That <hi>Phebus</hi> bluſh'd to ſee the Crimſon day,</l>
               <l>And muff'd in Clouds he turn'd his Face away;</l>
               <l>Not ſilver Hairs, nor Infant cryes could prove</l>
               <l>Of force ſufficient Tyrants hearts to move;</l>
               <l>Beauties in vain to blunt their fury ſtrive,</l>
               <l>Firſt raviſh'd are, and then ripp'd up alive,</l>
               <l>From Mothers Arms infeebl'd by a Wound;</l>
               <l>The Babe is ſnatch'd and daſh'd againſt the Ground:</l>
               <l>With Fire and Sword they triumph and declare</l>
               <l>Their black Commiſſions from the Prince of Air:</l>
               <l>This dreadful Beaſt whoſe craſhing Jaws devour</l>
               <l>The Nations up, receives the Dragons power;</l>
               <l>His burning rage in <hi>England</hi> has been ſeen</l>
               <l>To plague her ſubjects, tempts the eaſie Queen:</l>
               <l>Our brave Heroes fix their Eyes above,</l>
               <l>And dare his mallice, arm'd with ſacred love,</l>
               <l>Redeem'd from Earth, they dare the worſt of ill;</l>
               <l>They fear not him who can the Body kill;</l>
               <l>'Their Hands nor Foreheads never bore his Name,</l>
               <l>'Mount like <hi>Elijah</hi> up to Heaven in flame.</l>
               <l>'To quell this ſtorm begun, <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſent</l>
               <l>'Such ſaving Balm as heal'd our Government,</l>
               <l>And broke his Horn, with which he puſh'd down Kings,</l>
               <l>And reach'd the Stars with proud aſpiring wings;</l>
               <l>Then like himſelf he threatn'd with his Tails,</l>
               <l>And with dire plot our peaceful Land aſſails;</l>
               <l>Powder and Fire the Engin brought from Hell</l>
               <l>To ſhake the VVorlds affrighted Cittadel;</l>
               <l>But Heaven took care to blaſt that black deſign,</l>
               <l>And cruſh'd the Villains in their fatal Mine:</l>
               <l>The Net was laid, and they forgetting where,</l>
               <l>Groaping in darkneſs did themſleves enſnare.</l>
               <l>Where more than ſeventy years, like Snakes in Snow</l>
               <l>They ſeem'd benum'd, and ſcarce a motion ſhow.</l>
               <l>'Twas opportunity, not want of will,</l>
               <l>That cramp'd the Tyrant, made his mallice ſtill;</l>
               <l>Warm'd by the mildneſs of a gracious King,</l>
               <l>(Good next to him that made him) rears his Sting:</l>
               <l>All guilded o're as ſmooth as Man cou'd ſeign,</l>
               <l>Yet bears the deadly Poyſon in his Brain:</l>
               <l>His Mouth prepar'd a Flood to drive away</l>
               <l>The ſacred Church, and Cloud the States bright Ray.</l>
               <l>The firſt by deadly <hi>Acconite</hi> muſt dye,</l>
               <l>The next devour'd by ſwarming Locuſt ly;</l>
               <l>This Land ſo far for wholſome Laws renown'd,</l>
               <l>With Peace, with Plenty, and with Juſtice Crown'd;</l>
               <l>Rul'd by a Prince whom Heaven did ſo proclaim</l>
               <l>Before the Tribes on Earth, to bear his Name:</l>
               <l>A King ſo bounteous, merciful, and great,</l>
               <l>Beſides him none cou'd fill his Fathers Seat:</l>
               <l>So juſt, ſo good, the Power Immence thought fit,</l>
               <l>That Majeſty ſhould only Govern it.</l>
               <l>The mighty God before whoſe Throne there lies</l>
               <l>The flaming Seraphims, whoſe ſacred cries</l>
               <l>Are <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> and eternal praiſe;</l>
               <l>Glory and honour are before his Face:</l>
               <l>Thouſands of Angels, and ten thouſands ſtand,</l>
               <l>To execute his juſt, and great Command.</l>
               <l>In vain does thirſty <hi>Nimrod</hi> hunt for blood,</l>
               <l>Heaven ſees his ſecret Baths they are not good;</l>
               <l>He brake the Lions Jaws, redeem'd the Prey,</l>
               <l>The deeds of Darkneſs ſhew'd in perfect Day;</l>
               <l>Sav'd his Anointed, and our gracious King,</l>
               <l>To his great Name let's loud <hi>Hoſanna's</hi> ſing:</l>
               <l>He has remember'd mercy, ſtill does bleſs,</l>
               <l>And turns our Foes device to fooliſhneſs;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> Power, Salvation, Glory, Might,</l>
               <l>To him who dwells in everlaſting Light.</l>
